Ideas for improvements:
  => Replace terminal_test with cutoff_test (early termination)
    -> Set depth by time available
    -> Evaluation performed at cutoff
  => Heuristic function eval to replace utility function ***
    -> eval should order terminal nodes like utility
    -> should not take long! (you're wasting time that could be spent searching)
    -> For non-terminals, eval strongly correlated with actual chance of winning!
    -> Idea: weighted linear evaluation to combine n heuristics
      --> f = w1x1 + w2x2 + ... + wnxn
    -> must be a monotonic transformation
  => Opening books and endgame tables
    -> Do this last if you have time and the insight

General points
- board will never be all *, gravity always applied when board given
- total play time: 5 minutes
